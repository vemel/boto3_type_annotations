## How to use

This package by itself is not very useful, it just gives you access to all
underlying `boto3` services type annotations. Install `boto3-stubs` instead.

```bash
# install type annotations just for boto3
python -m pip install boto3-stubs

# install `boto3` type annotations
# for ec2, s3, rds, lambda, sqs, dynamo and cloudformation
# Consumes ~7 MB of space
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[essential]'

# or install annotations for services you use
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[acm,apigateway]'
```

### Type checking

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for services that you use to get type checking working.

```bash
# You can find a full list of modules below
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'
```

Use `boto3` with `{{ master_module_name }}` in your project and enjoy type checking.

```python
import boto3

from {{ master_module_name }} import s3

# Check if your IDE supports function overloads,
# you probably do not need explicit type annotations
# client = boto3.client("s3")
client: s3.S3Client = boto3.client("s3")

# Oh, it must be `Bucket`... Thanks, mypy!
client.create_bucket(bucket="bucket")
```

### Code auto-complete

Not a single Python IDE supports `Literal` type overloads yet (but in `VSCode` support is just around the corner).
Meanwhile, to have a nice auto-complete you can explicitly set types to help your IDE to get methods, arguments etc.

```python
import boto3_name

from {{ master_module_name }} import ec2

# this is the only place where you have to set types explicitly
client: ec2.EC2Client = boto3.client("ec2")
resource: ec2.EC2ServiceResource = boto3.resource("ec2")

# now you have auto-complete for methods, arguments and even return types
```

### Build services index

This packages provides a CLI to build services index for `boto3-stubs`.

```bash
# Use this command when you add or remove service packages
python -m mypy_boto3
```

## How it works

Fully automated [builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
