# 301 MOVED PERMANENTLY

Use https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder repository instead.

Thank you for your support, PRs and issue reports. With your help this project has
finally reached it's first stable version, got a new repository and fully automated builds.

However, there are still some things to do and you can help me to improve developer experience with `boto3`:

- Rethink index generation for installed sub-packages to finally switch to `whl` distribution
- Help `botocore` team to release their stubs generator using ideas from this package
- Fix `PyCharm` RAM consumption on function overloads with `Literal` arguments
- Improve [Python Language Server](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server)
  to add `Literal` function overloads support to `VSCode`

Good luck and take care!
